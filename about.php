            Welcome to <strong>Gremlin Diaries</strong>!!! . I am digital Gremlin , I find it very cool to tinker with diffrent technology .
            I love security, programming, electronics and blogging . i really love to open things to see how they work but usually they do not close back properly.
            People think i love damaging things  but in reality <em>i do not do the bad things they happen around me</em>.
